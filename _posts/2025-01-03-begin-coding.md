Learning how to code can be a very daunting task. Sometimes you'll see code that is super complicated, or you might find code that is super simple. <!--end--> Either way, learning how to code is fun and straightforward if you look in the right places. I started in middle school, taking a class taught through [code.org](https://code.org){:target="_blank"}. I excelled in that class; my teacher even allowed me to move on to another unit for learning web design.

Having a goal in mind is super important because you can become easily distracted by other languages. There are certain paths that you can follow to begin coding. If you want to be a software engineer, you can learn Python, C, Rust, and many more. If you want to learn web development, you can learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To become a game developer, you would use C#, C++, or Lua. There are multiple options and many paths you can follow; picking the right one is important.

If you want to get started with programming, I recommend starting with either web development or software development. Python is very easy to use and beginner-friendly. To get started with Python, I recommend you start [here](https://www.pythontutorial.net/){:target="_blank"}. Web development is a little bit more complicated but a lot easier to pick up once you get used to how it feels. It'll be a breeze. To start with web development, you can start [here](https://w3schools.com){:target="_blank"}.

There are also communities out there that can help you. On Discord, you can find [World of Coding](https://discord.gg/program){:target="_blank"}, and on Reddit, you can find [r/learnprogramming](https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming){:target="_blank"}. There are also several forums online, such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com){:target="_blank"}.

Overall, learning programming can be very fun and exciting. As long as you don't get lost, it should be very easy. There are communities full of people eager to help you and lots of opportunities to learn. I highly recommend checking out all the links I provided above, and if you want to reach out to me with questions, you can visit [this webpage](https://nicolas-okuly.github.io/contact.html){:target="_blank"}.
